                                    <p>One of the biggest concerns that people have when buying organic food is the authenticity of the product. The certification or labeling on the product will help you identify whether it is organic or non-organic. An international/domestic recognized body issues these certifications which are proudly claimed by us.</p>
                                    <p>In India, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is mandated to regulate the manufacture, distribution, sell, or import of organic foods as per the provisions laid under Section 22 of the Food Safety Standards Act, 2006. In India, organic foods are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards (Organic Foods) Regulations, 2017.</p>
                                    <p>The Jaivik Bharat logo for Organic Food identifies and distinguishes organic products from non-organic ones. Below the logo is the tagline, "Jaivik Bharat", which signifies Organic Food from India.</p>
                                    <p>As a consumer, you will need to look for the Jaivik Bharat logo and the FSSAI Logo License number.</p>

                                       <div id="accordion-4" class="accordion-section-content">
                                          <p>One of the biggest advantages of choosing organic produce is that you can reduce your exposure to harmful pesticides. Some studies have also suggested that organic produce may contain higher levels of vitamins and antioxidants as compared to conventionally grown produce. As organic farming involves sustainable methods, helps in soil fertility and promoting biodiversity, it positively impacts the environment as well.</p>

                                       <div id="accordion-5" class="accordion-section-content">
                                          <p>This may not always hold; in some cases, organic produce is on par or even more affordable than its conventional counterpart. It is important to remember:</p>
                                          <p>=> Organic produce requires more time to grow and is more labour intensive.</p>
                                          <p>=>Post-harvest processing and handling of organic food requires considerable investment to ensure no cross-contamination.</p>
                                          <p>As awareness around how opting for organic is beneficial for the consumer, farmer and the environment continues to increase, demand will also subsequently increase, further bringing down overall prices.</p>

                                       <div id="accordion-6" class="accordion-section-content">
                                          <p>The difference between conventional and organic produce comes from the difference in farming methods.</p>
                                          <p>Organic farming: In organic farming, agricultural products are grown and processed chemical-free, focussing on natural methods as much as possible. Only manure and compost are used for fertilization; crops are rotated, and insects, birds, and traps are harnessed to battle pests. There is no use of pesticides, additives, GMOs, growth regulators, and livestock feeds. Animals are fed on organic feed. Every country has its regulations but the underlying principle of organic farming is to grow produce that does not involve the use of chemicals or genetically modified crops.</p>
                                          <p>Conventional farming: Conventional farming involves the use of chemical fertilizers to promote plant growth. Pesticides, and chemical herbicides, are used; animals are fed antibiotics, and growth hormones; medications are used to ensure their growth and well-being. While these steps may be more cost-effective, they can, in the long-term possibly be harmful to the environment and for human consumption as well.</p>
